      <h2>About This Project</h2>
      <p>
        This project explores how solar energy can be used as a renewable and sustainable power source.
        Using principles of energy conversion and transport, we analyze how sunlight can be captured and
        converted into usable electricity through photovoltaic cells.

      <h2>Scientific Concepts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Energy Transport:</strong> Sunlight carries electromagnetic energy that can be absorbed by solar panels.</li>
        <li><strong>Energy Conversion:</strong> Photovoltaic cells convert light energy into electrical energy.</li>
        <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> The conversion efficiency depends on panel materials and sunlight intensity.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        By understanding solar energy potential, we can better design systems that reduce reliance on fossil fuels
        and support a sustainable energy future. This project connects to course objectives by analyzing energy
        transport, conversion, and comparison between renewable and nonrenewable sources.
